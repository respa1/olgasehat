# TODO: Configure Frontend Routes for Public Access

- [ ] Move frontend publik routes outside auth middleware in routes/web.php
- [ ] Move public frontend user routes (registration and login pages) outside auth middleware
- [ ] Ensure protected routes (dashboard, editprofile, riwayat*, backend) remain inside auth
- [ ] Test public access to frontend routes without login
